                    <h2>Being a queer professional</h2>
                    <br>
                    <article>
                        <p>
                            Why am I sharing this on my professional website? I
                            would have asked myself the same thing a few years ago.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I came out as gay a week before college. Things have
                            changed (for the better) since then. I have become
                            more comfortable with myself â€” and my queer identity
                            in particular. To clarify, queer is an umbrella term reclaimed
                            by activists and academics to refer to any LGBTQ identity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During my sophomore year, I attended Out for Undergrad Tech Conference (O4U Tech),
                            a pre-professional conference for high-achieving LGBTQ+ students interested
                            in technology. Here, I learned about the value of being out in the workplace.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The fight for gender and sexual minorities has made great strides in
                            past years. But there is still a heavy stigma surrounding these identities, and
                            it is a struggle to be open about this in the workplace. Expectations
                            of heterosexual relationships or cisgender identity is often assumed in the workplace,
                            and some states do not offer legal protections from discrimination against LGBTQ+ employees.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I choose to disclose my name and pronoun preference because visibility in the workplace
                            is important to me. Sure, including these facts may discourage some employers,
                            but would I be happy working for someone who does not support me? The answer is no.
                            I have a right to feel safe in the workplace as does any of my cisgender, heterosexual
                            counterparts. Furthermore, making myself visible can hopefully lead to other queer folk
                            being more comfortable in the workplace.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One may ask, "why do you still use the name Thomas if you're nonbinary?" I do this
                            because people hold inherent biases and will likely hold less regard for the work
                            of someone with a non-traditional name. Is this forsaking my queer identity or
                            my values of visibility? I don't think so. I think it's a compromise; I'm
                            using my legal name in a situation where nuance cannot be delivered (ie. through
                            the author line of a PDF) and using my preferred name otherwise (ie. in face-to-face
                            interaction).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So yes, maybe it is controversial that I'm sharing this information. And the question
                            may still stand: <i>why</i> am I sharing this? But to that I ask, why is this
                            considered controversial?
