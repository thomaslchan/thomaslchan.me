                    <h2>Discovering research as a career</h2>
                    <br>
                    <article>
                        <p>
                            I find it funny that people discuss degrees in terms
                            of employability. I definitely acknowledged the
                            resourcefulness of having a degree in both biology
                            and computer science, but economic gain was far from
                            my primary motive in choosing the two fields.
                            Nevertheless, I'd be rich (ironically) if I got a
                            penny every time somebody told me how employable my
                            degrees are.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Despite these comments, I didn't know what career
                            path to follow given my two degrees. I wanted to do
                            something that involved biology and computer
                            science. I was studying them in separate spheres
                            during the academic year and wanted to experience
                            them in an interdisciplinary context for the summer.
                            I also knew that internships are a pathway to a
                            full-time career — I didn't want to set myself onto
                            a path involving only one field. (I can't live
                            without both of them.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, for my sophomore year, I applied to National
                            Science Foundation programs, specifically research
                            experiences for undergraduates (REUs). One of the
                            programs I applied to was at the Boyce Thompson
                            Institute (BTI), a Cornell-affiliated lab
                            specializing in plant research. I had never had
                            formal research experience, so this was a great
                            opportunity. Additionally, I am very interested in
                            high-impact, mission-driven work. The lab I chose
                            focuses on improving crop yields and works with
                            institutions in developing nations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Needless to say, I had an amazing time at BTI and
                            fell in love with Ithaca. But I felt like I needed
                            to try out pure software engineering (SWE). I
                            applied to both REUs and SWE roles the next summer
                            and managed to get an interview with Google. I went
                            to final round interviews, but did not get an offer.
                            I'm sharing this because it's important to
                            acknowledge failure (especially in the sciences).
                            But I learned a lot from the process and am thankful
                            for having gone through it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Looking back, I'm glad I was rejected from Google —
                            otherwise, I would have taken the offer and missed
                            my experiences at Harvard Medical School (HMS). But
                            also, isn't hindsight 20/20? Talking to my peers,
                            including friends who have interned at Google, I'm
                            confident in my choice to not enter SWE. Without
                            going into too much detail, the nature of research
                            seems to be a better fit for me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I applied to REUs because I knew it was the right
                            path. The doubt I had in my mind was because my
                            peers were pursuing the traditional SWE route, and I
                            thought, "What if?" I don't blame myself for that
                            because it's a valid consideration. I am thankful
                            for my time at HMS independent of SWE; I learned so
                            much and befriended many intentional, intelligent
                            individuals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I see my journey like answering a multiple-choice
                            question. I could find the answer by process of
                            elimination (ie. trying out SWE and deciding I don't
                            like it), or I can be so confident in my answer that
                            I don't need to consider the other options (ie.
                            considering my time at BTI and HMS as life-changing).
                            And maybe to the person reading this, it seems like
                            I'm trusting in blind faith instead of trying other
                            options. But to me, it felt intrinsically right
                            doing biology and computer science research.
