                    <br>

                    <img class="profile" src="content/thomas.jpg" align: center>

                    <p>I hail from the small town of Wayland in Massachusetts. (There's
                    actually a display server protocol named after it.)
                    I went to the local high school and now attend Tufts University in
                    Medford, MA.</p>

                    <p>I am currently a sophomore majoring in biology and computer
                    science. I am interested in applications that involve the
                    intersection of both my concentrations: either
                    bioinformatics or computational biology.</p>

                    <p>I participate in many programming-related extracurriculars,
                    such as JumboCode, dedicated to developing software for non-profits
                    and federal organizations free of charge; Tufts Daily Web Team, which
                    manages the Tufts daily newspaper's website; oSTEM, which focuses on
                    LGBTQ+ individuals in the science, technology, engineering, and math
                    community; and Tufts Computer Science Exchange (CSX), which coordinates
                    the annual university hackathon PolyHack.</p>

                    <p>Outside of computer science, I am part of Tufts University
                    Social Collective (TUSC), organizing campus-wide social events,
                    and First-Year Orientation Community Service (FOCUS), leading
                    freshmen in community service Projects before the school year begins.
                    I also scoop at a local ice cream shop, J.P. Licks.</p>

                    <p>In my spare time, I practice digital photography and
                    videography. Additionally, I enjoy reading feminist and critical
                    race theory. You can find me in a caf√© enjoying a warm cup of tea
                    or coffee with friends.</p>
