                    <h2>Being a queer professional</h2>
                    <br>
                    <article>
                        <p>
                            I feel hesitant posting this, but I know it's the right thing
                            to do. Why am I sharing this on my professional website?
                            I would have asked myself the same thing a few years ago.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I came out as gay a week before college, and realized
                            I was transgender two and a half years later. Since
                            then, I have become more comfortable with my queer
                            identity. (Queer is an umbrella term reclaimed by
                            activists and academics to refer to any LGBTQ+ identity.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During my sophomore year, I attended the Out for Undergrad
                            Tech Conference (O4U Tech), a pre-professional conference
                            for high-achieving LGBTQ+ students interested in technology.
                            Here, I learned about the value of being out in the workplace.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Despite advances in past years, acceptance of gender
                            and sexual minorities is still not realized. Acknowledging
                            queer identities in the workplace is still considered
                            nonprofessional behavior, and some states do not offer
                            legal protections from discrimination against LGBTQ+ employees.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before, I would disclose it based on my perceptions of the company.
                            I would ask myself, "is this company or industry openly accepting
                            of queer individuals?" If I did choose to disclose it, I would
                            only acknowledge it through professional contexts. For example,
                            on my resume, I would include the O4U Tech conference or Out in
                            Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (oSTEM) on my
                            resume.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I now disclose my preferred name and pronoun preference in hope to make
                            queerness more visible in the workplace. Sure, including these
                            facts may be off-putting to some employers, but I would not be
                            content working for an unsupportive institution anyway. I should
                            feel as safe in the workplace as any of my cisgender, heterosexual
                            counterparts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are nuances to "outness," especially in the workplace. While
                            I feel comfortable sharing this information, I do not expect other
                            queer people to do the same. Coming out is a continual process; I'm
                            constantly meeting new people and have to decide how to be out to them
                            and to what extent. It always depends on my own comfort and prioritizing
                            safety.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, I still use my legal name for professional purposes. This
                            is because many people hold less regard for people with non-traditional
                            names, and in turn, may have biases toward their work. Is this forsaking
                            my values of visibility? I don't think so. I view it more as code-switching:
                            I use my legal name in contexts where nuance cannot be delivered (eg. through
                            the author line of an article), and I use my preferred name otherwise
                            (eg. in face-to-face interaction).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Maybe it is controversial that I'm sharing this information, but this
                            shouldn't be the case. My identity is not deviant or inappropriate,
                            not even in a workplace environment. And, I want to make that clear.
                            If you feel the need to ask me why I am sharing this, I'd ask in return
                            why you feel the need to ask me that question in the first place.
                        </p>
