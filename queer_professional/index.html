                    <h2>Being a queer professional</h2>
                    <br>
                    <article>
                        <p>
                            Why am I sharing this on my professional website? I
                            would have asked myself the same thing a few years ago.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I came out as gay a week before college. Things have
                            changed (for the better) since then. I have become
                            more comfortable with myself â€” my queer identity
                            in particular. To clarify, queer is an umbrella term reclaimed
                            by activists and academics to refer to any LGBTQ identity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During my sophomore year, I attended Out for Undergrad Tech Conference (O4U Tech),
                            a pre-professional conference for high-achieving LGBTQ+ students interested
                            in technology. Here, I learned about the value of being out in the workplace.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The fight for gender and sexual minorities has made great strides in
                            past years, but there is still a heavy stigma surrounding these identities.
                            It is a struggle to be open about this in the workplace; expectations
                            being cisgender or having heterosexual relationships is the norm,
                            and some states do not offer legal protections from discrimination against LGBTQ+ employees.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I choose to disclose my name and pronoun preference because visibility in the workplace
                            is important to me. Sure, including these facts may be off-putting to some employers,
                            but I would not be content working for an unsupportive company anyway.
                            I should feel safe in the workplace as should any of my cisgender, heterosexual
                            counterparts. Furthermore, making myself visible can hopefully lead to other queer folk
                            being more comfortable in the workplace.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are compromises I still make as a queer individual. For exampe, I still use my
                            legal name for professional purposes. This is because many people hold inherent biases
                            and will likely hold less regard for the work of someone with a non-traditional name.
                            Is this forsaking my queer identity or my values of visibility? I don't think so.
                            I'm using my legal name in a situation where nuance cannot be delivered (ie. through
                            the author line of a PDF) and using my preferred name otherwise (ie. in face-to-face
                            interaction).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So yes, maybe it is controversial that I'm sharing this information. And the question
                            may still stand: <i>why</i> am I sharing this? But to that I ask, why is sharing this
                            considered controversial?
