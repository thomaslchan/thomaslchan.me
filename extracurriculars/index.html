                    <h2>Value in extracurriculars</h2>
                    <br>
                    <article>
                        <p>
                            As my time at Tufts is coming to a close, I find myself
                            reflecting more on the experiences and forms of growth
                            that have occurred since I first step foot on campus.
                            I've realized how much I've learned — not only in class,
                            but outside of the classroom. Some of my favorite college
                            memories were made through my extracurricular activities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before I arrived at Tufts, I reached out to the news
                            editor of the Tufts Daily. I was heavily involved in
                            my <a href="https://waylandstudentpress.com/">high school
                            publication</a>, and wanted to continue in college.
                            I worked as a copy editor for a year and a web editor
                            for another, but I then left to pursue other interests.
                            I felt obligated to continue for the sake of demonstrating
                            committment, but I also wasn't finding the same fulfillment
                            as I did with Wayland Student Press Network. Although this
                            was a hard decision, it was an important step in recognizing
                            how I can box myself in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This pressure I felt was not an isolated case. I was also
                            part of Tufts University Social Collective (TUSC), resposible
                            for organizing social events for the student body. I had a
                            wonderful time and continued with it through my sophomore year.
                            But with junior year approaching, I needed to better balance
                            my schedule and not spread myself so thin. Leaving TUSC, only
                            compounded my anxiety. I was worried about showing committment
                            and leaving two clubs in a year would be scar on my record.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Other issues that came up were the need for extracurriculars that
                            were relevant to my professional life. I needed more experience
                            and wanted to show work I did outside of the classroom. I joined
                            major-related organizations like Out in Science, Technology,
                            Engineering, and Mathematics (oSTEM) or JumboCode. oSTEM
                            is a pre-professional organization that helped me network with
                            other queer individuals, and JumboCode allowed me to make
                            software for non-governmental organizations free-of-charge!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am incredibly greatful for my time at these organizations.
                            I learned so, so much — things that I could never learn in a
                            classroom setting. And I've made connections with people that
                            transcended club settings. I still keep in touch with those
                            who've graduated and those still in clubs I have since left.
                            But I've also learned a lot from my troubles with leaving these
                            clubs and exploring other extracurriculars.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I realized how important is to prioritize my own happiness.
                            Worrying about what appears on a resume is a valid concern, but it
                            shouldn't compromise your happiness or wellbeing. Even more, boxing yourself
                            into extracurriculars for the sake of committment can be exhausting,
                            and speading yourself too thin can actually be more unproductive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Secondly, you can show committment through continued use of skill
                            even if you're developing these skills through different mean. (It's
                            like having new internships each summer.) Although I left TUSC,
                            I still organized events through Tufts Computer Science Exchange (CSX).
                            I joined Tufts CSX my sophomore year, eventually becoming president
                            and now shifting to a more advisory role.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, the most important thing I've learned is the value of
                            exploring extracurriculars that are not necessarily linked to
                            your major. I enjoyed developing for the Tufts Daily and JumboCode,
                            but I also learned so much through the non-academic work I did
                            through my other activities. I was a leader of eight incoming
                            students for First-Year Orientation CommUnity Service (FOCUS).
                            The program allowed me to mentor first-years through LGBTQ+
                            and racial equity-based community service. A form of work that
                            is so rewarding in ways different from academic work.

                            Some cool things I've done through my activies include:
