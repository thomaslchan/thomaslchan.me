                    <h2>Finding passion in work</h2>
                    <br>
                    <article>
                        <p>
                            My passion for biology started young. I asked a
                            million questions about how life worked that my parents
                            could never answer. I finally had a formal introduction
                            in 7th grade, but my experience was less than ideal. The
                            teacher deducted points for my first quiz - apparently
                            plants produce "food" and not sugar. Thankfully, I
                            had the opportunity to take honors biology in 9th
                            grade with Deanna Hoffman, who consistently answered
                            all of my questions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My love for computer science, on the other hand, was
                            pure chance. My friend suggested I take AP Computer Science
                            A with her for our senior year elective. Her parents were
                            software engineers and recommended it. At this point, I had no
                            idea what computer science was. I thought I would hack computers
                            and build hardware. Most people in the class had previous
                            experience or expert resources externally. I felt like an underdog,
                            but I began to thrive and found happiness in the work I was doing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These formative experiences in high school guided my decision
                            to double major in biology and computer science upon matriculating
                            at Tufts University. I didn't know exactly what career I was aiming
                            for with the two fields, but I knew they made me happy and that
                            I wanted to continue studying them. I did exactly that for the
                            next three and a half years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Studying biology and computer science at the university level was
                            different at the high school level. Though there were
                            times when the workload or material was more difficult, I was always
                            able to manage myself. The real distinction from my previous
                            experience was due to the nature of the work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I decided to study biology and computer science was
                            purely due to passion. It's because I feel tied to the work emotionally;
                            I am invested in the process and the outcomes to the point where it feels
                            effortless. But I didn't always feel this way when doing work for class.
                            Some assignments just didn't pique my interest, which is strange considering
                            I always felt strong interest in the concepts discussed in class.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It had gotten to the point where I forgot why I liked the subjects. But
                            I realized I just wasn't deriviing enjoyment from the work I was doing; it
                            felt like a chore. I remembered how much fun I had making Space Invaders in
                            AP CS and doing problem sets in AP Biology. But through that discovery,
                            I found a way to get through it and reignite my love for CS and biology.
                            I needed to reframe my work, treat the problems like games or find some
                            relevance to a topic I find important.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My passion for the two disciplines has not only grown stronger through my
                            studies, but it has also evolved â€” I love them differently than before.
                            Looking back, I'm thankful for pursuing my passions without hesitance.
                            I have gained amazing techniques to booster my determination in my work
                            and have full confidence in devoting my life's work to the two subjects.
