                    <h2>Finding passion in work</h2>
                    <br>
                    <article>
                        <p>
                            My interest in biology started young. I asked about a
                            million questions about how life works that my parents
                            could never answer. Ironically, my formal introduction
                            in 7th grade provided little help as well. The teacher
                            deducted points for my first quiz - apparently
                            plants produce "food" and not sugar. Thankfully, I
                            had the opportunity to take honors biology in 9th
                            grade with a more competant teacher who consistently answered
                            all of my questions. (Shoutout to Deanna Hoffamn for
                            inspiring me to pursue a career in biology.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My love for computer science, on the other hand, was
                            pure chance. My friend suggested I take Advanced Placement
                            Computer Science A with her for our senior year elective.
                            Her parents were software engineers and recommended it.
                            At this point, I had no idea what computer science entailed.
                            I thought I would hack computers and build hardware.
                            Unlike me, most people in the class had previous
                            experience or external access to professionals.
                            Needless to say, I felt like an underdog. But I
                            eventually began to thrive and found happiness in the
                            work I was doing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These formative experiences in high school guided my
                            decision to double major in biology and computer science
                            upon matriculating at Tufts University. I didn't know
                            exactly what careers were tailored for the two fields,
                            but I knew they made me happy and that I wanted to
                            continue studying them. I did exactly that for the
                            next three and a half years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Studying biology and computer science at the university
                            level introduced new obstacles. Though there were times
                            when the workload or material was more difficult than
                            in high school, I was always able to manage myself. The real
                            distinction from my previous experience was due to the
                            nature of the work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The decision to study biology and computer science was
                            purely due to passion. It's because I feel tied to the
                            work emotionally; I am invested in the process and the
                            outcomes to the point where it feels effortless. But I
                            didn't always feel this way when doing work for class.
                        </p>

                            High school biology was a time to ask unlimited questions.
                            You weren't confined to the scope of the course. This
                            seemingly changed in college. Furthermore, the degrees
                            required courses that weren't necessarily of interest,
                            while my high school curriculum focused more on concepts
                            that interested me. (Though, I did love general genetics
                            and molecular biology at Tufts.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It had gotten to the point where I would doubt my
                            interest the subjects. But I realized my disatisfaction
                            was because I viewed the work as a chore. I remembered
                            how much fun I in the classes I loved, and how those
                            feelings now felt so foreign in classes I was forced
                            to take. But this didn't have to be the case.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I found ways to reignite the feelings I had since lost.
                            I focused on reframing the work. I started viewing
                            debugging code as a puzzle I need to solve or finding
                            relevance to topics that interest me. Recognizing value
                            in my assignments and future applications of gained skills
                            also helped my enthusiasm.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I realized these skills could be applied to my research.
                            There are always parts of the process that I look forward
                            too, that make me want to stay in the lab until late at
                            night. But there are also parts that seem laborious.
                            These newly aquired techniques can definitely extend to
                            my future work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm thankful for having jumped into my passions without hesitance.
                            My passion for the two disciplines has evolved. I still
                            love them just as much, but I now love them more fully.
                            I am able to love more than just the "good" parts. I can
                            enjoy the parts I didn't think I could love before.
