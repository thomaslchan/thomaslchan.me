                    <h3>Image Compression</h3>
                    <p>
                        The program accepts a PPM image as input and compresses
                        the image. The compression process begins by converting
                        pixel color values from the RGB format to the component
                        video format through a discrete cosine transform. It
                        then packs the resulting values into binary words. The
                        program can decompress images through the inverse
                        procedure.

                        <br>
                        This project was part of the coursework for COMP40:
                        Machine Architecture and Assembly Language, assigned
                        with the intention of understanding floating point
                        arithmetic in C. I partnered with
                        <a href="https://stevensong.me/">Steven Song</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Network Scan Alarm</h3>
                    <p>
                        This program can perform live sniffing of a network
                        (default eth0) or analyze packet data given a pcap file.
                        The alarm can detect NULL, FIN, Xmas, and Nikto scans;
                        usernames/passwords sent via HTTP Basic Authentication
                        or FTP; and identify source IPs from Russia or Facebook.
                        This was written in Python, using the scapy and pcapy
                        libraries.

                        <br>
                        This project was assigned by COMP116: Introduction to
                        Computer Security.

                    <h3>Arbitrary-precision Arithmetic</h3>
                    <p>
                        After loading the program in the interpeter, users can
                        define arbitrary-precision natural numbers and perform
                        computations using them. This was done by defining
                        classes for natural, positive integers, and negative
                        integers, and defining methods for the combination
                        of these numbers. This was written in Î¼Smalltalk.

                        <br>
                        This was an assignment from COMP105: Programming
                        Languages. It emphasized the use of double dispatch and
                        selective exposure of internal data representation.
                        I partnered with Khaliun Narangerel.
