                    <h3>Kanto Invaders</h3>
                    <p>T his was written as a post-exam project for the Advanced
                    Placement computer science course. This is my own version of
                    the game Space Invaders. The player must destroy ships as
                    they continuously move across the screen. The player must
                    avoid being hit by the enemy ships, lest the player lose a
                    life. All characters are modeled after Pok√©mon characters
                    from the Nintendo Franchise. It was implemented in Java. </p>

                    <h3>SongWorm</h3>
                    <p> This was written during Tufts Polyhack 2017. It takes
                    text from the user and generates sounds, mapping each letter
                    to one of five notes. Essentially, it's a text-to-sound
                    converter. This was a collaborative effort with four other
                    Tufts students. It was implemented with HTML, CSS, and
                    Javascript.</p>

                    <h3>Personal Website</h3>
                    <p>This was a personal project. This served as a
                    crash-course in basic front-end development to satisfy my
                    own interest. It was implemented with HTML, CSS (with
                    Bootstrap), and Javascript.</p>
