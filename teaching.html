                    <br>

                    <p>
                        I worked as a teaching assistant during my undergraduate
                        studies at Tufts University.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <h3>COMP170: Theory of Computation</h3>
                    <p><i>September 2019 - January 2020</i></p>
                    <p>
                        I co-led recitations of about 25 students, and I graded
                        homeworks and the final exam. I also held office hours
                        attended by about 10 students. I also reviewed homework
                        materials before they were sent to students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Topics included: models of computation, finite automata,
                        regular languages, context free grammars,
                        Turing machines, undecidability, diagonalizations,
                        nondeterminism, etc.
                    </p>

                    <h3>COMP15: Data Structures</h3>
                    <p><i>February 2019 - May 2019</i></p>
                    <p>
                        I assisted with a laboratory class of around 20 students
                        and graded projects and exams. I also hosted office
                        hours attended by upwards of 30 students. Programming
                        assignments were written in C++.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Topics included: abstraction, software design, linked
                        lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, sorting algorithms,
                        graphs, and hashing.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <h3>COMP40: Machine Structure and Assembly Language</h3>
                    <p><i>September 2018 - January 2019</i></p>
                    <p>
                        I graded design documents for assigned projects and
                        aided about 20 students during office hours. Programming
                        assignments were written in C.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Topics included: memory, caches, registers, machine
                        arithmetic, bitwise operations, and the structure
                        of/interaction between assembly code, relocatable object
                        code, and binary machine code.
                    </p>
