                    <h2>Research</h2>

                    <br>

                    <h3>Boyce Thompson Institute</h3>
                    <p>In the summer of 2018, I worked under Lukas Mueller. I
                    created a marker-pedgree visualization tool for
                    <a href="https://www.cassavabase.org/">CassavaBase</a>. The
                    tool is designed for genomics-assisted breeding of cassava.
                    Breeders can select crop accessions and SNPs, and the tool
                    will render the data as a pedigree with each individual's
                    SNP values displayed adjecent to it. It was written with Perl,
                    JavaScript (D3), and PostgreSQL.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Blavatnik Institute</h3>
                    <p>This summer, I'm working with Nils Gehlenborg at Harvard
                    Medical School's Department of Biomedical Informatics.
                    I'm working on a tool for single cell experiment data, 
                    <a href="http://vitessce.io/">vitessce.io</a>.

                    <h2>Projects</h2>

                    <br>

                    <h3>Kanto Invaders</h3>
                    <p>This was written as a post-exam project for the Advanced
                    Placement computer science course. This is my own version of
                    the game Space Invaders. The player must destroy ships as
                    they continuously move across the screen. The player must
                    avoid being hit by the enemy ships, lest the player lose a
                    life. All characters are modeled after Pok√©mon characters
                    from the Nintendo Franchise. It was implemented in Java. </p>

                    <h3>SongWorm</h3>
                    <p> This was written during Tufts Polyhack 2017. It takes
                    text from the user and generates sounds, mapping each letter
                    to one of five notes. Essentially, it's a text-to-sound
                    converter. This was a collaborative effort with four other
                    Tufts students. It was implemented with HTML, CSS, and
                    Javascript.</p>
