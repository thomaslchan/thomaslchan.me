                    <h3>Boyce Thompson Institute</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the summer of 2018, I worked under Lukas Mueller. I
                        created a marker-pedgree visualization tool for
                        <a href="https://www.cassavabase.org/">CassavaBase</a>. The
                        tool is designed for genomics-assisted breeding of cassava.
                        Breeders can select crop accessions and SNPs, and the tool
                        will render the data as a pedigree with each individual's
                        SNP values displayed adjecent to it. It was written with Perl,
                        JavaScript (D3), and PostgreSQL. You can find the presentation
                        slides <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17pBXFz_upDsP6gSGJ27AqoAxP7wfaC9i_Ksq6mslh1Q/">here</a>.

                    <h3>Blavatnik Institute</h3>
                    <p>This past summer, I worked with Nils Gehlenborg at Harvard
                    Medical School's Department of Biomedical Informatics.
                    I developed on a tool for single cell experiment data,
                    <a href="http://vitessce.io/">vitessce.io</a>. I focused on
                    the image processing pipeline for microscopy data. You can
                    find the presentation slides
                    <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IRWDofdvKS3qbLY-s0a1EUijha3m-JopMYgmETOIHq0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

                    <br>

                    <h3>Image Compression</h3>
                    <p>
                        This was written in C. The program accepts a PPM image as input
                        and compresses the image. The compression process begins
                        by converting pixel color values from the RGB format to the
                        component video format through a discrete cosine transform.
                        It then packs the resulting values into binary words. The
                        program can decompress images through the inverse procedure.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This project was part of the coursework for COMP40: Machine
                        Architecture and Assembly Language, assigned with the intention
                        of understanding floating point arithmetic in C. I partnered
                        with <a href="https://stevensong.me/">Steven Song</a>.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <h3>Network Scan Alarm</h3>
                    <p>
                        This was written in Python, using the scapy and pcapy
                        libraries. It can perform live sniffing of a network
                        (default eth0) or analyze packet data given a pcap file. The
                        alarm can detect NULL, FIN, Xmas, and Nikto scans; usernames/passwords
                        sent via HTTP Basic Authentication or FTP; or identify source IPs
                        from Russia or Facebook.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This project was assigned by COMP116: Introduction to Computer Security.

                    <h3>Arbitrary-precision Arithmetic</h3>
                    <p>
                        This was written in Î¼Smalltalk. After loading the program
                        in the interpeter, users can define infinite-precision
                        natural numbers and perform computations using them. This
                        was done by defining classes for natural, positive integers,
                        and negative integers, and defining methods for the combination
                        of these numbers.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This was an assignment from COMP105: Programming Languages.
                        It emphasized the use of double dispatch and selective exposure
                        of internal data representation. I partnered with Khaliun
                        Narangerel.
